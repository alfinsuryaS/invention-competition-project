# Let's Go - Invention Competition Project
A project that I presented during the [Invention Udayana](https://www.invention-udayana.com/) web design competition in 2018, with the theme **"Promoting Bali Tourism with Technology"**. This website is a static site, and single page design. At this time, I was in the 3rd grade of vocational high school, and I was very grateful that I won 1st place ðŸ”¥

Honestly, very proud to be able to compete with great people, and to be able to contribute in this competition.
